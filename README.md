### My old development written in 2003-2006 years.

I present here is the source code partially saved and written by me
from 2003 to 2006 on programming language Tcl/Tk (originally from
Tool Command Language, but conventionally spelled "Tcl" rather than
"TCL"; pronounced as "tickle" or "tee-see-ell") is a scripting language
created by John Ousterhout.

In those days, it was my favorite programming language for writing GUIs,
as we now say backend. I did not like the Delphi and Pascal.
The examples of writing programs , I took with NASA and other
research institutions for the visualization and presentation of
scientific data. Here are some examples of their work on Tcltk.

[DS9 - astronomical visualization application from SAO](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)

[FITSview - FITS image viewer from NRAO](http://www.nrao.edu/software/fitsview/)

[GAIA - Graphical Astronomy and Image Analysis Tool](http://astro.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/gaia/gaia.html)

[SkyCat - ESO tool combines image visualization and access to catalogs](http://archive.eso.org/cms/tools-documentation/skycat/eso-skycat-download.html)

[ESO-MIDAS - system provides general tools for image processing and data reduction](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas/)

[IRAF - the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility](http://iraf.noao.edu/)


Let me remind you what and where did TclTk.

The combination of Tcl and the Tk GUI toolkit is referred to as Tcl/Tk.
The Tcl programming language was created in the spring of 1988 by John
Ousterhout while working at the University of California, Berkeley.
