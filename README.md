### My old development written in 2003-2006 years.

I present here is the source code partially saved and written by me
from 2003 to 2006 on programming language Tcl/Tk (originally from
Tool Command Language, but conventionally spelled "Tcl" rather than
"TCL"; pronounced as "tickle" or "tee-see-ell") is a scripting language
created by John Ousterhout.

In those days, it was my favorite programming language for writing GUIs,
as we now say backend. I did not like the Delphi and Pascal.
The examples of writing programs , I took with NASA and other
research institutions for the visualization and presentation of
scientific data


The combination of Tcl and the Tk GUI toolkit is referred to as Tcl/Tk.
The Tcl programming language was created in the spring of 1988 by John
Ousterhout while working at the University of California, Berkeley.
